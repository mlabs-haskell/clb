# CLB

Welcome to the CLB!

CLB is a Cardano emulator, provided as a Haskell library. Learn more in the
[docs](https://mlabs-haskell.github.io/clb-docs).

CLB was developed by [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city/)
in Fund10 of [Project Catalyst](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1000118).

In combination with [Atlas](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas)
CLB is a complete replacement to decomissioned [PSM](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) library.

Check out an article on MLabs website on [testing dApps on Cardano](https://www.mlabs.city/blog/testing-dapps-on-cardano-with-clb-emulator) with CLB.
