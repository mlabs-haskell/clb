# CLB

Welcome to the CLB!

CLB is a two-in-one Cardano emulator - a Haskell library and an executable.
Learn more in [docs](https://mlabs-haskell.github.io/clb-docs).

CLB was developed by [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city/)
in Fund10 of [Project Catalyst](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1000118).

In combination with [Atlas](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas)
CLB is a complete replacement to decomissioned [PSM](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) library.
